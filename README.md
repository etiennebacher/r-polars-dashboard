This dashboard shows the list of functions and parameters in the py-polars and r-polars APIs. The objective is to have the same APIs. If a function or argument is present in python but not in R, it's highlighted in red. 

**NOTE:** currently, this dashboard doesn't take into account deprecated functions and arguments in the py-polars API. Therefore, it's up to you to check that this argument or functions is a true missing functionality in R (and not something that will disappear in the python API in a few releases anyway).
